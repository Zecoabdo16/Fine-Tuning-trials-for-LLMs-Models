i  have 2 folders witht the same structure , each folder contains folders and each folder contains sub folders that contains files.

i want you to read the the file names in the first folder  then read these files from folder 2 after removing the format with .txt in the from the first one. 

after that i want you to create csv file with these columns ( content  that contains the txt from the file, 'class ' that contains the folder names, sub classes which has sub folder name and text name after renaming it to txt from step 1)
