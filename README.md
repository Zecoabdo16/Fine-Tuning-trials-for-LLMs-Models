Documenting Document Sensitivity Labels: A Guide

Introduction

This document outlines various approaches to determining the sensitivity level (Top Secret, Secret, Public Consider) of a document based on its content. Sensitivity labels are crucial for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring appropriate access controls.

Sensitivity Levels

Top Secret: Information that could cause exceptionally grave damage to national security.
Secret: Information that could cause serious damage to national security.
Public Consider: Information that may be unclassified but is considered sensitive for other reasons (e.g., proprietary, competitive).
Approaches for Sensitivity Label Classification

Manual Mapping (1-to-1):

Description: The most straightforward approach, where specific keywords or phrases directly map to sensitivity levels.
Pros: Simple to implement, effective for well-defined terminology.
Cons: Inflexible, requires continuous updates as jargon evolves, error-prone due to human subjectivity.
Best Use: When sensitivity terms are limited, well-established, and unlikely to change significantly.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for Topic Modeling:

Description: A statistical method for uncovering hidden thematic structures (topics) within a collection of documents.
Process:
Preprocess documents (cleaning, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization).
Train an LDA model on a corpus of labeled documents (Top Secret, Secret, Public Consider).
Analyze the topics generated by the model and assign sensitivity labels based on topic associations (e.g., "military operations" might correspond to Top Secret).
Pros: Captures semantic relationships, can handle unseen data to some extent.
Cons: Relies heavily on training data quality and quantity, may require domain knowledge for topic interpretation, potentially computationally expensive.
Best Use: When dealing with large document sets and where semantic relationships are crucial for classification.
TF-IDF + K-Means Clustering:

Description: Combines TF-IDF for term weighting and K-Means clustering for grouping similar documents into sensitivity categories.
Process:
Preprocess documents as in LDA.
Calculate TF-IDF weights for terms in each document.
Use TF-IDF vectors as input to K-Means clustering, where pre-labeled documents (Top Secret, Secret, Public Consider) are used as initial centroids.
Pros: Efficient for large datasets, leverages term importance, potentially more interpretable than LDA.
Cons: Requires tuning of K (number of clusters), sensitive to document representation (TF-IDF may not capture all nuances).
Best Use: When dealing with large collections and interpretability of results is important.
Light Language Model Classifiers:

Description: Utilize pre-trained language models (e.g., DistilBERT, MobileBERT) fine-tuned for sensitivity classification.
Process:
Preprocess documents as in LDA.
Fine-tune a pre-trained language model on a dataset of labeled documents.
Predict sensitivity labels for new documents based on the fine-tuned model.
Pros: High accuracy potential, can capture complex semantic relationships, handles unseen data well.
Cons: Requires specialized knowledge for fine-tuning, can be computationally expensive, susceptible to biases in training data.
Best Use: When dealing with very sensitive data, large datasets, and high accuracy is paramount (resources permitting).
Comparison and Recommendations

The optimal approach depends on your specific needs, data size, and resource constraints:

For small datasets and well-defined sensitivity terms: Manual mapping might suffice.
For larger datasets and capturing semantic relationships: Consider LDA or TF-IDF + K-Means.
For highest accuracy with large datasets: Light language model classifiers could be ideal (given resource availability and careful training).
Additional Considerations

Training Data Quality and Quantity: High-quality labeled data is essential for all machine learning approaches.
Domain Expertise: Some methods may benefit from domain knowledge for topic interpretation.
Performance Monitoring and Improvement: Monitor classification accuracy and make adjustments as needed.
By carefully evaluating these approaches and considerations, you can select the most effective method for determining document sensitivity labels, ensuring the appropriate protection of your sensitive information.
